> Build a school library ruby App that has the following features : -
1-List all books inside the library 
2-List all people that has permission to enter the library 
3- register new person either a student or a teacher 
4- register new book 
5- create a rental to track each book rented by person x 
6- list all rentals by person x just by giving his ID to the App
7- Exit to quit the application
All the work is done using through following OOP styling paradigm I created classes for every given input entity like student , teacher, book, rental then i create assoction between them for example student and teacher has `many-to-many` relation ship with book so i created rental class to link these two classes together.
